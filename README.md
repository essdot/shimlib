# shimlib - A Useful Javascript Library

Shimlib is a Javascript library that does things with functions, arrays, objects, and more. It's a personal project, implementing things I have found necessary or convenient at different times. It can be used to shim missing functionality like Object.keys, Function.prototype.bind, and more. 

Some of its functions are similar to what you'll find in  [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) and  [es5-shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim). It also includes a simple class library for doing classical inheritance in Javascript, and some very handy serialization/deserialization for query strings.

Shimlib's unit tests use [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) and [chai](http://chaijs.com/). There are also integration tests for ensuring that it has the same behavior as native functions. Shimlib aims to work if Javascript builtins have been altered, and provides tests for that too. Shimlib's functionality is split into node-style modules.

Gulp tasks are provided for preparing scripts. Browserify is used to resolve the node modules into a single script for running the specs in the browser.


## Installing

    sh ./install.sh

(Installs browserify, and mocha for the test runner)

## Running tests

Unit tests can be run on the command line, or in a browser. To run tests on the command line, run `npm test` or `mocha`. To run the tests in a browser, run `node bin/serve` and browse to [http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444).

## Notes

Currently, the toFixed implementation simply truncates and does not do decimal rounding.

## Thanks

The server script and general browser test setup was taken from the wonderful js-assessment by Rebecca Murphy: https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment
